In his new novel, Deep River, Marlantes turn to another mode of storytelling—the family epic—to craft a stunningly expansive narrative that is no le rich and honest in it depiction of human suffering, courage, and reinvention. Born into a farm family in late nineteenth-century Finland, the three Koski siblings—Ilmari, Matti, and Aino—are brought up on the virtue of maintaining their sisu in the face of increasing hardship, especially after their nationalist father is arrested by imperial Russian authorities, never to be seen again. Lured by the prospect of the Homestead Act, Ilmari and Matti set sail for America, and the politicized young Aino, haunted by the specter of betrayal after her Marxist cell is disastrously exposed, follows soon after. Not far from the majestic Columbia River and in the shadow of Douglas fir a hundred meter high, the brother have established themselves among a logging community in southern Washington, and it is here, in the New World, that each sibling come into their own—Ilmari a the family’s spiritual rock; Matti a a fearless logger and the embodiment of the entrepreneurial spirit; and Aino a a fiercely independent woman and union activist who, time and again, sacrifice for the political belief that have sustained her through it all. Layered with fascinating historical detail, this is a novel that breathes deeply of the sun-dappled forest and bear witness to the stump-ridden field the loggers, and the first wave of modernity, leave behind. At it heart, Deep River is an extraordinarily ambitious exploration of the place of the individual, and of the immigrant, in an America still in the process of defining it own identity.',\n",

En Viena, una mujer se vale de su don de ver el futuro para convertirse en la adivina de una familia rica. En Ginebra, el conductor de una ambulancia y su esposa acogen al abandonado y aparentemente moribundo ex presidente de un país caribeño, solo para descubrir que sus ambiciones políticas siguen intactas. En estos doce relatos magistrales acerca de la vidas de latinoamericanos en Europa, García Márquez transmite la melancolía, tenacidad, pena y ambición que forma la experiencia del emigrante. «El esfuerzo de escribir un cuento corto e tan intenso como empezar una novela. Pues en el primer párrafo de una novela hay que definir todo: estructura, tono, estilo, ritmo, longitud y a veces hasta el carácter de algún personaje. Lo demás e el placer de escribir, el más íntimo y solitario que pueda imaginarse, y si uno no se queda corrigiendo el libro por el resto de la vida e porque el mismo rigor de fierro que hace falta para empezarlo se impone para terminarlo. El cuento, en cambio, no tiene principio ni fin: fragua o no fragua. Y si no fragua, la experiencia propia y la ajena enseñan que la mayoría de la veces e más saludable empezarlo de nuevo por otro camino, o tirarlo a la basura.» El escritor John Updike ha dicho... «El cuerpo de sus cuentos está lleno de riqueza y sorpresas, y su vestido e la elocuencia.

Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swan until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that human are hardwired to learn specific when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on thing we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don't know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the 'impossible'.\",\n",

After Clarence see his friend cut down breaching the West Wall and holding the line in the Battle of the Bulge, he and his crew are given a weapon with the power to avenge their fallen brothers: the Pershing, a state-of-the-art “super tank,” one of twenty in the European theater. But with it come a harrowing new responsibility: Now they will spearhead every attack. That’s how Clarence, the corporal from coal country, find himself leading the U.S. Army into it largest urban battle of the European war, the fight for Cologne, the “Fortress City” of Germany. Battling through the ruins, Clarence will engage the fearsome Panther in a duel immortalized by an army cameraman. And he will square off with Gustav Schaefer, a teenager behind the trigger in a Panzer IV tank, whose crew ha been sent on a suicide mission to stop the Americans. As Clarence and Gustav trade fire down a long boulevard, they are taken by surprise by a tragic mistake of war. What happens next will haunt Clarence to the modern day, drawing him back to Cologne to do the unthinkable: to face his enemy, one last time.

       " 'NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Paul Kennedy, award-winning author of The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers and one of today’s most renowned historians, now provides a new and unique look at how World War II wa won. Engineers of Victory is a fascinating nuts-and-bolts account of the strategic factor that led to Allied victory. Kennedy reveals how the leaders’ grand strategy wa carried out by the ordinary soldiers, scientists, engineers, and businessmen responsible for realizing their commanders’ vision of success. In January 1943, FDR and Churchill convened in Casablanca and established the Allied objective for the war: to defeat the Nazi blitzkrieg; to control the Atlantic sea lane and the air over western and central Europe; to take the fight to the European mainland; and to end Japan’s imperialism. Astonishingly, a little over a year later, these ambitious goal had nearly all been accomplished. With riveting, tactical detail, Engineers of Victory reveals how. Kennedy recount the inside story of the invention of the cavity magnetron, a miniature radar “as small a a soup plate,” and the Hedgehog, a multi-headed grenade launcher that allowed the Allies to overcome the threat to their convoy crossing the Atlantic; the critical decision by engineer to install a super-charged Rolls-Royce engine in the P-51 Mustang, creating a fighter plane more powerful than the Luftwaffe’s; and the innovative use of pontoon bridge (made from raft strung together) to help Russian troop cross river and elude the Nazi blitzkrieg. He take reader behind the scenes, unveiling exactly how thousand of individual Allied plane and fighting ship were choreographed to collectively pull off the invasion of Normandy, and illuminating how crew chief perfected the high-flying and inaccessible B-29 Superfortress that would drop the atomic bomb on Japan. The story of World War II is often told a a grand narrative, a if it were fought by superman or decided by fate. Here Kennedy uncovers the real hero of the war, highlighting for the first time the creative strategies, tactics, and organizational decision that made the lofty Allied objective into a successful reality. In an even more significant way, Engineers of Victory ha another claim to our attention, for it restores “the middle level of war” to it rightful place in history. Praise for Engineers of Victory “Superbly written and carefully documented . . . indispensable reading for anyone who seek to understand how and why the Allies won.”—The Christian Science Monitor “An important contribution to our understanding of World War II . . .

One world had ended and a new, uncertain one wa beginning. Regime change had come on a global scale: across Asia (including China, Korea, Indochina, and the Philippines, and of course Japan) and all of continental Europe. Out of the often vicious power struggle that ensued emerged the modern world a we know it. In human terms, the scale of transformation is almost impossible to imagine. Great city around the world lay in ruins, their population decimated, displaced, starving. Harsh revenge wa meted out on a wide scale, and the ground wa laid for much horror to come. At the same time, in the wake of unspeakable loss, the euphoria of the liberated wa extraordinary, and the revelry unprecedented. The postwar year gave rise to the European welfare state, the United Nations, decolonization, Japanese pacifism, and the European Union. Social, cultural, and political “reeducation” wa imposed on vanquished by victor on a scale that also had no historical precedent. Much that wa done wa ill advised, but in hindsight, a Ian Buruma show us, these effort were in fact relatively enlightened, humane, and effective. A poignant grace note throughout this history is Buruma’s own father’s story. Seized by the Nazis during the occupation of Holland, he spent much of the war in Berlin a a laborer, and by war’s end wa literally hiding in the rubble of a flattened city, having barely managed to survive starvation rations, Allied bombing, and Soviet shock troop when the end came. His journey home and attempted reentry into “normalcy” stand in many way for his generation’s experience. A work of enormous range and stirring human drama, conjuring both the Asian and European theater with equal fluency, Year Zero is a book that Ian Buruma is perhaps uniquely positioned to write.

       " '#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Everybody tell you to live for a cause larger than yourself, but how exactly do you do it? The author of The Road to Character explores what it take to lead a meaningful life in a self-centered world. Every so often, you meet people who radiate joy—who seem to know why they were put on this earth, who glow with a kind of inner light. Life, for these people, ha often followed what we might think of a a two-mountain shape. They get out of school, they start a career, and they begin climbing the mountain they thought they were meant to climb. Their goal on this first mountain are the one our culture endorses: to be a success, to make your mark, to experience personal happiness. But when they get to the top of that mountain, something happens. They look around and find the view . . . unsatisfying. They realize: This wasn’t my mountain after all. There’s another, bigger mountain out there that is actually my mountain. And so they embark on a new journey. On the second mountain, life move from self-centered to other-centered. They want the thing that are truly worth wanting, not the thing other people tell them to want. They embrace a life of interdependence, not independence. They surrender to a life of commitment. In The Second Mountain, David Brooks explores the four commitment that define a life of meaning and purpose: to a spouse and family, to a vocation, to a philosophy or faith, and to a community. Our personal fulfillment depends on how well we choose and execute these commitments. Brooks look at a range of people who have lived joyous, committed lives, and who have embraced the necessity and beauty of dependence. He gather their wisdom on how to choose a partner, how to pick a vocation, how to live out a philosophy, and how we can begin to integrate our commitment into one overriding purpose. In short, this book is meant to help u all lead more meaningful lives. But it’s also a provocative social commentary. We live in a society, Brooks argues, that celebrates freedom, that tell u to be true to ourselves, at the expense of surrendering to a cause, rooting ourselves in a neighborhood, binding ourselves to others by social solidarity and love. We have taken individualism to the extreme—and in the process we have torn the social fabric in a thousand different ways. The path to repair is through making deeper commitments. In The Second Mountain, Brooks show what can happen when we put commitment-making at the center of our lives.',\n",

When she wa in her mid-twenties and still living in Germany, Arendt wrote about the history of German Jews a a people living in a land that wa not their own. In 1933, at the age of twenty-six, she fled to France, where she helped to arrange for German and eastern European Jewish youth to quit Europe and become pioneer in Palestine. During her year in Paris, Arendt’s principal concern wa with the transformation of antisemitism from a social prejudice to a political policy, which would culminate in the Nazi “final solution” to the Jewish question–the physical destruction of European Jewry. After France fell at the beginning of World War II, Arendt escaped from an internment camp in Gurs and made her way to the United States. Almost immediately upon her arrival in New York she wrote one article after another calling for a Jewish army to fight the Nazis, and for a new approach to Jewish political thinking. After the war, her attention wa focused on the creation of a Jewish homeland in a binational (Arab-Jewish) state of Israel. Although Arendt’s thought eventually turned more to the meaning of human freedom and it inseparability from political life, her original conception of political freedom cannot be fully grasped apart from her experience a a Jew. In 1961 she attended Adolf Eichmann’s trial in Jerusalem. Her report on that trial, Eichmann in Jerusalem, provoked an immense controversy, which culminated in her virtual excommunication from the worldwide Jewish community.

We become happy through finding a purpose, realizing our potential, and modifying our behavior to become the best version of ourselves. With these objective in mind, Aristotle developed a humane program for becoming a happy person, which ha stood the test of time, comprising much of what today we associate with the good life: meaning, creativity, and positivity.

Two year later, his prediction were borne out by the rise to power of a series of political outsider whose economic nationalism and authoritarian tendency threatened to destabilize the entire international order. These populist nationalist seek direct charismatic connection to “the people,” who are usually defined in narrow identity term that offer an irresistible call to an in-group and exclude large part of the population a a whole. Demand for recognition of one’s identity is a master concept that unifies much of what is going on in world politics today.

Populist nationalism, said to be rooted in economic motivation, actually spring from the demand for recognition and therefore cannot simply be satisfied by economic means. The demand for identity cannot be transcended; we must begin to shape identity in a way that support rather than undermines democracy.

Emerging in early modern Europe to defuse violent religious conflict and reduce persecution, tolerance today is hailed a a key to decreasing conflict across a wide range of other dividing lines-- cultural, racial, ethnic, and sexual. But, a political theorist Wendy Brown argues in Regulating Aversion, tolerance also ha dark and troubling undercurrents. Dislike, disapproval, and regulation lurk at the heart of tolerance. To tolerate is not to affirm but to conditionally allow what is unwanted or deviant. And, although presented a an alternative to violence, tolerance can play a part in justifying violence--dramatically so in the war in Iraq and the War on Terror. Wielded, especially since 9/11, a a way of distinguishing a civilized West from a barbaric Islam, tolerance is paradoxically underwriting Western imperialism. Brown's analysis of the history and contemporary life of tolerance reveals it in a startlingly unfamiliar guise. Heavy with norm and consolidating the dominance of the powerful, tolerance sustains the abjection of the tolerated and equates the intolerant with the barbaric. Examining the operation of tolerance in context a different a the War on Terror, campaign for gay rights, and the Los Angeles Museum of Tolerance, Brown trace the operation of tolerance in contemporary struggle over identity, citizenship, and civilization.\",\n",

Instead, Huxley chose to revisit the world he created in a set of twelve essay in which he meditates on how his fantasy seemed to be becoming a reality and far more quickly than he ever imagined. That Huxley’s book Brave New World had been largely prophetic about a dystopian future a great distress to Huxley. By 1958, Huxley wa sixty-four-years old; the world had been transformed by the event of World War II and the terrifying advent of nuclear weapons. Peeking behind the Iron Curtain where people were not free but instead governed by Totalitarianism, Huxley could only bow to grim prophecy of his friend, author George Orwell, (author of the book 1984). It struck Huxley that people were trading their freedom and individualism in exchange for the illusory comfort of sensory pleasure--just a he had predicted in Brave New World. Huxley despair of contemporary humankind’s willingness to surrender freedom for pleasure. Huxley worried that the rallying cry, “Give me liberty or give me death” could be easily replaced by “Give me television and hamburgers, but don’t bother me with the responsibility of liberty.” Huxley saw hope in education; education that could teach people to see beyond the easy slogan and efficient end and anesthetic-like influence of propaganda.',\n",

       " 'One of the most revered spiritual leader in the world today teach u how to find nirvana—how to live most deeply and peacefully every day. Many people believe that nirvana is a state of nonbeing that can only be reached through death. In The Art of Living, Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh dispels this dangerous misconception, and teach u how to enjoy enlightenment in this life without losing ourselves. We need our body to touch nirvana—to experience it with our feet, our eyes, our hands. That is the reality of no birth and no death, no afflictions, no burning, the extinction of the flames. The Buddha himself ha said, \"my teaching is not about nonbeing. My teaching is to overcome the notion of being and nonbeing.\" In The Art of Living, Thich Nhat Hanh explores two essential questions: What happens when we are still alive? What happens when we die? As he ultimately shows, if you can answer the first question, the answer to the second come easily. Based on the last full talk he gave before his sudden hospitalization, this thought-provoking book is filled with simple meditation and practice that focus on recognizing our interconnectedness with those around us, a well a with nonliving being and the entire cosmos. Arranged in short section around a few common themes, these teaching offer opportunity and inspiration for being fully alive in the present moment—consciousness that allows u to to face aging, dying, and the unknown with curiosity and joy and without fear. With powerful mindfulness, concentration, and insight, we can live deeply every moment of our daily life and touch our enlightened nature. When we become aware of our cosmic body, of our God body, of our nirvana body, then we are no longer afraid of birth and death, being and nonbeing.

       " 'Although mammal and bird are widely regarded a the smartest creature on earth, it ha lately become clear that a very distant branch of the tree of life ha also sprouted higher intelligence: the cephalopods, consisting of the squid, the cuttlefish, and above all the octopus. In captivity, octopus have been known to identify individual human keepers, raid neighboring tank for food, turn off lightbulb by spouting jet of water, plug drains, and make daring escapes. How is it that a creature with such gift evolved through an evolutionary lineage so radically distant from our own? What doe it mean that evolution built mind not once but at least twice? The octopus is the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. What can we learn from the encounter? In Other Minds, Peter Godfrey-Smith, a distinguished philosopher of science and a skilled scuba diver, tell a bold new story of how subjective experience crept into being—how nature became aware of itself. As Godfrey-Smith stresses, it is a story that largely occurs in the ocean, where animal first appeared. Tracking the mind’s fitful development, Godfrey-Smith show how unruly clump of seaborne cell began living together and became capable of sensing, acting, and signaling. As these primitive organism became more entangled with others, they grew more complicated. The first nervous system evolved, probably in ancient relative of jellyfish; later on, the cephalopods, which began a inconspicuous mollusks, abandoned their shell and rose above the ocean floor, searching for prey and acquiring the greater intelligence needed to do so. Taking an independent route, mammal and bird later began their own evolutionary journeys. But what kind of intelligence do cephalopod possess? Drawing on the latest scientific research and his own scuba-diving adventures, Godfrey-Smith probe the many mystery that surround the lineage. How did the octopus, a solitary creature with little social life, become so smart? What is it like to have eight tentacle that are so packed with neuron that they virtually “think for themselves”? What happens when some octopus abandon their hermit-like way and congregate, a they do in a unique location off the coast of Australia? By tracing the question of inner life back to it root and comparing human being with our most remarkable animal relatives, Godfrey-Smith cast crucial new light on the octopus mind—and on our own.',\n",

Yet how parent seek to achieve this ambition varies enormously. For instance, American and Chinese parent are increasingly authoritative and authoritarian, whereas Scandinavian parent tend to be more permissive. Why? Love, Money, and Parenting investigates how economic force and growing inequality shape how parent raise their children. From medieval time to the present, and from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden to China and Japan, Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti look at how economic incentive and constraints—such a money, knowledge, and time—influence parenting practice and what is considered good parenting in different countries. Through personal anecdote and original research, Doepke and Zilibotti show that in country with increasing economic inequality, such a the United States, parent push harder to ensure their child have a path to security and success. Economics ha transformed the hands-off parenting of the 1960s and ’70s into a frantic, overscheduled activity. Growing inequality ha also resulted in an increasing “parenting gap” between richer and poorer families, raising the disturbing prospect of diminished social mobility and fewer opportunity for child from disadvantaged backgrounds. In nation with le economic inequality, such a Sweden, the stake are le high, and social mobility is not under threat. Doepke and Zilibotti discus how investment in early childhood development and the design of education system factor into the parenting equation, and how economics can help shape policy that will contribute to the ideal of equal opportunity for all. Love, Money, and Parenting present an engrossing look at the economics of the family in the modern world.',\n",

Our project dealt with the application of Say’s Law to the supply of immigrant labor, meaning that when the supply of immigrant labor grows in an area, the new immigrants, being consumers, bolster labor demand and help to offset the lower wage they may bring about. Our test case wa the seemingly obscure Dawson County, Nebraska, where the meatpacking industry experienced a relatively huge increase in Hispanic-born labor supply around 1990. We found for Dawson County this ‘‘demand effect’’ to be signi?cant and our result for this test case generalizable to other, more prominent, test cases. This inspired u to study the famous Mariel Boatlift, where Miami’s labor force grew suddenly by 7% due to the arrival of nearly 125,000 Cuban refugee in the spring of 1980. In that study, we showed that the Marielitos exerted a signi?cant demand effect, which we argue help to account for the stylized fact that the Mariel in?ux had a relatively benign effect on the Miami labor market. We had the privilege of presenting both study at various conference in the USA, Norway, Taiwan and Israel, and these study have been published in Labour Economics and the Research in Labor Economics series (both study are discussed in detail in this book).',\n",

Destutt de Tracy wa one of the founder of the classical liberal republican group known a the Idéologues, which included Benjamin Constant, Jean-Baptiste Say, Marquis de Condorcet, and Madame de Staël.

Breaking with the physiocratic orthodoxy of the eighteenth century, Destutt de Tracy denies that land is the source of all productive labour and focus his attention upon manufacturing and manufacturer a the producer of utility and, therefore, of value and of wealth. Placing the entrepreneur at the centre of his view of economic activity, he argues against luxurious consumption of the idle rich and recommends a market economy with low taxation and minimum state intervention.

Beginning with the opening “Proem” (prologue poem)—“I am a Negro: / Black a the night is black, / Black like the depth of my Africa”—Hughes spoke directly, intimately, and powerfully of the experience of African Americans at a time when their voice were newly being heard in our literature. As the legendary Carl Van Vechten wrote in a brief introduction to the original 1926 edition, “His cabaret song throb with the true jazz rhythm; his sea-pieces ache with a calm, melancholy lyricism; he cry bitterly from the heart of his race . . . Always, however, his stanza are subjective, personal,” and, he concludes, they are the expression of “an essentially sensitive and subtly illusive nature.” That illusive nature dart among these early line and begin to reveal itself, with precocious confidence and clarity. In a new introduction to the work, the poet and editor Kevin Young suggests that Hughes from this very first moment is “celebrating, critiquing, and completing the American dream,” and that he manages to take Walt Whitman’s American “I” and write himself into it. We find here not only such classic a “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and the great twentieth-century anthem that begin “I, too, sing America,” but also the poet’s shorter lyric and fancies, which dream just a deeply. “Bring me all of your / Heart melodies,” the young Hughes offers, “That I may wrap them / In a blue cloud-cloth / Away from the too-rough finger / Of the world.” From the Hardcover edition.',\n",

As Wood reveals, the period wa marked by tumultuous change in all aspect of American life--in politics, society, economy, and culture. The men who founded the new government had high hope for the future, but few of their hope and dream worked out quite a they expected. They hated political party but party nonetheless emerged. Some wanted the United States to become a great fiscal-military state like those of Britain and France; others wanted the country to remain a rural agricultural state very different from the European states. Instead, by 1815 the United States became something neither group anticipated. Many leader expected American culture to flourish and surpass that of Europe; instead it became popularized and vulgarized. The leader also hope to see the end of slavery; instead, despite the release of many slave and the end of slavery in the North, slavery wa stronger in 1815 than it had been in 1789.

At the end of the 19th century, everyone knew that people were defined by their race and sex and were fated by birth and biology to be more or le intelligent, able, nurturing, or warlike. But one rogue researcher looked at the data and decided everyone wa wrong. Franz Boas wa the very image of a mad scientist: a wild-haired immigrant with a thick German accent. By the 1920s he wa also the foundational thinker and public face of a new school of thought at Columbia University called cultural anthropology. He proposed that culture did not exist on a continuum from primitive to advanced. Instead, every society solves the same basic problems--from childrearing to how to live well--with it own set of rules, beliefs, and taboos. Boas's student were some of the century's intellectual stars: Margaret Mead, the outspoken field researcher whose Coming of Age in Samoa is one of the most widely read work of social science of all time; Ruth Benedict, the great love of Mead's life, whose research shaped post-Second World War Japan; Ella Deloria, the Dakota Sioux activist who preserved the tradition of Native Americans of the Great Plains; and Zora Neale Hurston, whose study under Boas fed directly into her now-classic novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God. Together, they mapped vanishing civilization from the Arctic to the South Pacific and overturned the relationship between biology and behavior. Their work reshaped how we think of woman and men, normalcy and deviance, and re-created our place in a world of many culture and value systems. Gods of the Upper Air is a page-turning narrative of radical idea and adventurous lives, a history rich in scandal, romance, and rivalry, and a genesis story of the fluid conception of identity that define our present moment.\",\n",

That same year, a trove of Michael Jackson memorabilia—including his iconic crystal-encrusted white glove—was sold at auction for over $1 million to a guy who was, officially, just the lowly forestry minister of the tiny nation of Equatorial Guinea. And in 2014, Ukrainian revolutionary raided the palace of their ousted president and found a zoo of peacocks, gilded toilets, and a floating restaurant modeled after a Spanish galleon. Unlikely a it might seem, there is a thread connecting these events, and Rachel Maddow follows it to it crooked source: the unimaginably lucrative and equally corrupting oil and gas industry. With her trademark black humor, Maddow take u on a switchback journey around the globe, revealing the greed and incompetence of Big Oil and Gas along the way, and drawing a surprising conclusion about why the Russian government hacked the 2016 U.S. election. She deftly show how Russia’s rich reserve of crude have, paradoxically, stunted it growth, forcing Putin to maintain his power by spreading Russia’s rot into it rivals, it neighbors, the West’s most important alliances, and the United States. Chevron, BP, and a host of other industry player get their star turn, most notably ExxonMobil and the deceptively well-behaved Rex Tillerson. The oil and gas industry ha weakened democracy in developed and developing countries, fouled ocean and rivers, and propped up authoritarian thief and killers. But being outraged at it is, according to Maddow, “like being indignant when a lion take down and eats a gazelle. You can’t really blame the lion. It’s in her nature.” Blowout is a call to contain the lion: to stop subsidizing the wealthiest business on earth, to fight for transparency, and to check the influence of the world’s most destructive industry and it enablers. The stake have never been higher. As Maddow writes, “Democracy either win this one or disappears.”',\n",

       " \"The #1 New York Times bestseller. New York Times Book Review 10 Best Books of 2017 Pulitzer Prize winner Ron Chernow return with a sweeping and dramatic portrait of one of our most compelling general and presidents, Ulysses S. Grant. Ulysses S. Grant's life ha typically been misunderstood. All too often he is caricatured a a chronic loser and an inept businessman, or a the triumphant but brutal Union general of the Civil War. But these stereotype don't come close to capturing him, a Chernow show in his masterful biography, the first to provide a complete understanding of the general and president whose fortune rose and fell with dizzying speed and frequency. Before the Civil War, Grant wa flailing. His business venture had ended dismally, and despite distinguished service in the Mexican War he ended up resigning from the army in disgrace amid recurring accusation of drunkenness. But in war, Grant began to realize his remarkable potential, soaring through the rank of the Union army, prevailing at the battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign, and ultimately defeating the legendary Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Along the way, Grant endeared himself to President Lincoln and became his most trusted general and the strategic genius of the war effort. Grant’s military fame translated into a two-term presidency, but one plagued by corruption scandal involving his closest staff members. More important, he sought freedom and justice for black Americans, working to crush the Ku Klux Klan and earning the admiration of Frederick Douglass, who called him “the vigilant, firm, impartial, and wise protector of my race.” After his presidency, he wa again brought low by a dashing young swindler on Wall Street, only to resuscitate his image by working with Mark Twain to publish his memoirs, which are recognized a a masterpiece of the genre. With lucidity, breadth, and meticulousness, Chernow find the thread that bind these disparate story together, shedding new light on the man whom Walt Whitman described a “nothing heroic... and yet the greatest hero.” Chernow’s probing portrait of Grant's lifelong struggle with alcoholism transforms our understanding of the man at the deepest level. This is America's greatest biographer, bringing movingly to life one of our finest but most underappreciated presidents. The definitive biography, Grant is a grand synthesis of painstaking research and literary brilliance that make sense of all side of Grant's life, explaining how this simple Midwesterner could at once be so ordinary and so extraordinary.

A forgotten, dark chapter of American history with implication for the current day, The Guarded Gate tell the story of the scientist who argued that certain nationality were inherently inferior, providing the intellectual justification for the harshest immigration law in American history. Brandished by the upper class Bostonians and New Yorkers—many of them progressives—who led the anti-immigration movement, the eugenic argument helped keep hundred of thousand of Jews, Italians, and other unwanted group out of the US for more than 40 years. Over five year in the writing, The Guarded Gate tell the complete story from it beginning in 1895, when Henry Cabot Lodge and other Boston Brahmins launched their anti-immigrant campaign. In 1921, Vice President Calvin Coolidge declared that “biological laws” had proven the inferiority of southern and eastern Europeans; the restrictive law wa enacted three year later. In his characteristic style, both lively and authoritative, Okrent brings to life the rich cast of character from this time, including Lodge’s closest friend, Theodore Roosevelt; Charles Darwin’s first cousin, Francis Galton, the idiosyncratic polymath who gave life to eugenics; the fabulously wealthy and profoundly bigoted Madison Grant, founder of the Bronx Zoo, and his best friend, H. Fairfield Osborn, director of the American Museum of Natural History; Margaret Sanger, who saw eugenics a a sensible adjunct to her birth control campaign; and Maxwell Perkins, the celebrated editor of Hemingway and Fitzgerald. A work of history relevant for today, The Guarded Gate is an important, insightful tale that painstakingly connects the American eugenicists to the rise of Nazism, and show how their belief found fertile soil in the mind of citizen and leader both here and abroad.',\n",

After Theodore Roosevelt led his Rough Riders to victory during the Spanish American War, he boasted of the diversity of his men\\'s origins- from the Kentucky backwoods to the Irish, Italian, and Jewish neighborhood of northeastern cities. Roosevelt’s vision of a hybrid and superior “American race,” strengthened by war, would inspire the social, diplomatic, and economic policy of American liberal for decades. And yet, for all of it appeal to the civic principle of inclusion, this liberal legacy wa grounded in “Anglo-Saxon” culture, making it difficult in particular for Jews and Italians and especially for Asians and African Americans to gain acceptance. Gerstle weave a compelling story of events, institutions, and idea that played on perception of ethnic/racial difference, from the world war and the labor movement to the New Deal and Hollywood to the Cold War and the civil right movement. We witness the remnant of racial thinking among such liberal a FDR and LBJ; we see how Italians and Jews from Frank Capra to the creator of Superman perpetuated the New Deal philosophy while suppressing their own ethnicity; we feel the frustration of African-American serviceman denied the opportunity to fight for their country and the moral outrage of more recent black activists, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Fannie Lou Hamer, and Malcolm X. Gerstle argues that the civil right movement and Vietnam broke the liberal nation apart, and his analysis of this upheaval lead him to ass Reagan’s and Clinton’s attempt to resurrect nationalism. Can the United States ever live up to it civic creed? For anyone who view racism a an aberration from the liberal premise of the republic, this book is must reading.

Victorian operating theatre were known a 'gateways of death', Fitzharris reminds us, since half of those who underwent surgery didn't survive the experience. This wa an era when a broken leg could lead to amputation, when surgeon often lacked university degrees, and were still known to ransack cemetery to find cadavers. While the discovery of anaesthesia somewhat lessened the misery for patients, ironically it led to more deaths, a surgeon took greater risks. In squalid, overcrowded hospitals, doctor remained baffled by the persistent infection that kept mortality rate stubbornly high. At a time when surgery couldn't have been more dangerous, an unlikely figure stepped forward: Joseph Lister, a young, melancholy Quaker surgeon. By making the audacious claim that germ were the source of all infection - and could be treated with antiseptic - he changed the history of medicine forever. With a novelist's eye for detail, Fitzharris brilliantly conjures up the grisly world of Victorian surgery, revealing how one of Britain's greatest medical mind finally brought century of savagery, sawing and gangrene to an end.

About the Peloponnesian War that devastated ancient Greece, the historian Thucydides explained: ‘It wa the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.’ Over the past 500 years, these condition have occurred sixteen times. War broke out in twelve of them. Today, a an unstoppable China approach an immovable America, and both Xi Jinping and Donald Trump promise to make their country ‘great again’, the seventeenth case look grim. Unless China is willing to scale back it ambition or Washington can accept becoming number two in the Pacific, a trade conflict, cyberattack, or accident at sea could soon escalate into all-out war. In Destined for War, the eminent Harvard scholar Graham Allison explains why Thucydides’s Trap is the best lens for understanding U.S.-China relation in the twenty-first century. Through uncanny historical parallel and war scenarios, he show how close we are to the unthinkable. Yet, stressing that war is not inevitable, Allison also reveals how clashing power have kept the peace in the past — and what painful step the United States and China must take to avoid disaster today.',\n",

For centuries, scientific thought wa focused on bringing order to the natural world. But even a relativity and quantum mechanic undermined that rigid certainty in the first half of the twentieth century, the scientific community clung to the idea that any system, no matter how complex, could be reduced to a simple pattern. In the 1960s, a small group of radical thinker began to take that notion apart, placing new importance on the tiny experimental irregularity that scientist had long learned to ignore. Miniscule difference in data, they said, would eventually produce massive ones—and complex system like the weather, economics, and human behavior suddenly became clearer and more beautiful than they had ever been before. In this seminal work of scientific writing, James Gleick lay out a cutting edge field of science with enough grace and precision that any reader will be able to grasp the science behind the beautiful complexity of the world around us.

Epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee and her husband, psychologist Tom Patterson, were vacationing in Egypt when Tom came down with a stomach bug. What at first seemed like a case of food poisoning quickly turned critical, and by the time Tom had been transferred via emergency medevac to the world-class medical center at UC San Diego, where both he and Steffanie worked, blood work revealed why modern medicine wa failing: Tom wa fighting one of the most dangerous, antibiotic- resistant bacteria in the world. Frantic, Steffanie combed through research old and new and came across phage therapy: the idea that the right virus, aka \"the perfect predator,\" can kill even the most lethal bacteria. Phage treatment had fallen out of favor almost 100 year ago, after antibiotic use went mainstream. Now, with time running out, Steffanie appealed to phage researcher all over the world for help. She found ally at the FDA, researcher from Texas A&M, and a clandestine Navy biomedical center-and together they resurrected a forgotten cure. A nail-biting medical mystery, The Perfect Predator is a story of love and survival against all odds, and the (re)discovery of a powerful new weapon in the global superbug crisis.',\n",

And in addition to relief, the fading of his suicidal thought brought curiosity. Where had they come from? Would they return? Is the suicidal impulse found in other animals? Or is our vulnerability to suicide a uniquely human evolutionary development? In Suicidal, Bering answer all these question and more, taking u through the science and psychology of suicide, revealing it cognitive secret and the subtle trick our mind play on u when we’re easy emotional prey. Scientific studies, personal stories, and remarkable cross-species comparison come together to help reader critically analyze their own doomsday thought while gaining broad insight into a problem that, tragically, will most likely touch all of u at some point in our lives.

Bestseller nacional e internacional, este libro explora la formas en que la biología y la historia no han definido y han mejorado nuestra comprensión de lo que significa ser «humano». Hace 70.000 años al menos seis especies de humanos habitaban la Tierra. Hoy solo queda una, la nuestra: Homo Sapiens. ¿Cómo logró nuestra especie imponerse en la lucha por la existencia? ¿Por qué nuestros ancestros recolectores se unieron para crear ciudades y reinos? ¿Cómo llegamos a creer en dioses, en naciones o en los derechos humanos; a confiar en el dinero, en los libros o en la leyes? ¿Cómo acabamos sometidos a la burocracia, a los horarios y al consumismo? ¿Y cómo será el mundo en los milenios venideros? En Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari traza una breve historia de la humanidad, desde los primeros humanos que caminaron sobre la Tierra hasta los radicales y a veces devastadores avances de la tres grandes revoluciones que nuestra especie ha protagonizado: la cognitiva, la agrícola y la científica. A partir de hallazgos de disciplinas tan diversas como la biología, la antropología o la economía, Harari explora cómo la grandes corrientes de la historia han modelado nuestra sociedad, los animales y la plantas que no rodean e incluso nuestras personalidades. ¿Hemos ganado en felicidad a medida que ha avanzado la historia? ¿Seremos capaces de liberar alguna vez nuestra conducta de la herencia del pasado? ¿Podemos hacer algo para influir en los siglos futuros?

In the great hall of science, dogma hold that Darwin\\'s theory of natural selection explains every branch on the tree of life: which specie thrive, which wither away to extinction, and what feature each evolves. But can adaptation by natural selection really account for everything we see in nature? Yale University ornithologist Richard Prum—reviving Darwin\\'s own views—thinks not. Deep in tropical jungle around the world are bird with a dizzying array of appearance and mating displays: Club-winged Manakins who sing with their wings, Great Argus Pheasants who dazzle prospective mate with a four-foot-wide cone of feather covered in golden 3D spheres, Red-capped Manakins who moonwalk. In thirty year of fieldwork, Prum ha seen numerous display trait that seem disconnected from, if not outright contrary to, selection for individual survival. To explain this, he dust off Darwin\\'s long-neglected theory of sexual selection in which the act of choosing a mate for purely aesthetic reasons—for the mere pleasure of it—is an independent engine of evolutionary change. Mate choice can drive ornamental trait from the constraint of adaptive evolution, allowing them to grow ever more elaborate. It also set the stake for sexual conflict, in which the sexual autonomy of the female evolves in response to male sexual control. Most crucially, this framework provides important insight into the evolution of human sexuality, particularly the way in which female preference have changed male bodies, and even maleness itself, through evolutionary time. The Evolution of Beauty present a unique scientific vision for how nature\\'s splendor contributes to a more complete understanding of evolution and of ourselves.',\n",

Featured in New York Times' Paperback Row A New York Times Book Review Editors' ChoiceAn Amazon Best Business & Leadership Book of 2017 Longlisted for Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year 2017A strategy+business Best Business Book of 2017 Move Fast and Break Things is the riveting account of a small group of libertarian entrepreneur who in the 1990s began to hijack the original decentralized vision of the Internet, in the process creating three monopoly firms--Facebook, Amazon, and Google--that now determine the future of the music, film, television, publishing and news industries. Jonathan Taplin offer a succinct and powerful history of how online life began to be shaped around the value of the men who founded these companies, including Peter Thiel and Larry Page: overlooking piracy of books, music, and film while hiding behind opaque business practice and subordinating the privacy of individual user in order to create the surveillance-marketing monoculture in which we now live. The enormous profit that have come with this concentration of power tell their own story. Since 2001, newspaper and music revenue have fallen by 70 percent; book publishing, film, and television profit have also fallen dramatically. Revenues at Google in this same period grew from $400 million to $74.5 billion.

More creative content is being consumed than ever before, but le revenue is flowing to the creator and owner of that content. The stake here go far beyond the livelihood of any one musician or journalist. As Taplin observes, the fact that more and more Americans receive their news, a well a music and other form of entertainment, from a small group of company pose a real threat to democracy. Move Fast and Break Things offer a vital, forward-thinking prescription for how artist can reclaim their audience using knowledge of the past and a determination to work together.

       " 'Videogames are an expressive medium, and a persuasive medium; they represent how real and imagined system work, and they invite player to interact with those system and form judgment about them. In this innovative analysis, Ian Bogost examines the way videogames mount argument and influence players. Drawing on the 2,500-year history of rhetoric, the study of persuasive expression, Bogost analyzes rhetoric\\'s unique function in software in general and videogames in particular. The field of medium study already analyzes visual rhetoric, the art of using imagery and visual representation persuasively. Bogost argues that videogames, thanks to their basic representational mode of procedurality (rule-based representation and interactions), open a new domain for persuasion; they realize a new form of rhetoric. Bogost call this new form \"procedural rhetoric,\" a type of rhetoric tied to the core affordances of computers: running process and executing rule-based symbolic manipulation. He argues further that videogames have a unique persuasive power that go beyond other form of computational persuasion. Not only can videogames support existing social and cultural positions, but they can also disrupt and change these position themselves, leading to potentially significant long-term social change. Bogost look at three area in which videogame persuasion ha already taken form and show considerable potential: politics, advertising, and learning.',\n",

       " '«Patagonia» dicevano Coleridge e Melville, per significare qualcosa di estremo. «Non c’è più che la Patagonia, la Patagonia, che si addica alla mia immensa tristezza» cantava Cendrars agli inizi di questo secolo. Dopo l’ultima guerra, alcuni ragazzi inglesi, fra cui l’autore di questo libro, chini sulle carte geografiche, cercavano l’unico luogo giusto per sfuggire alla prossima distruzione nucleare. Scelsero la Patagonia. E proprio in Patagonia si sarebbe spinto Bruce Chatwin, non già per salvarsi da una catastrofe, ma sulle tracce di un mostro preistorico e di un parente navigatore. Li trovò entrambi – e insieme scoprì ancora una volta l’incanto del viaggiare, quell’incanto che è così facile disperdere, da quando ogni luogo del mondo è innanzitutto il pretesto per un inclusive tour. Eppure, eccolo di nuovo: l’inesauribile richiamo, il vagabondo trasalire di un’ombra – il viaggiatore – fra scene sempre mutevoli. E nulla si rivelerà così mutevole come la Patagonia, che si presenta come un deserto: «nessun suono tranne quello del vento, che sibilava fra i cespugli spinosi e l’erba morta, nessun altro segno di vita all’infuori di un falco e di uno scarafaggio immobile su una pietra bianca». All’interno di questa natura, che ha l’astrattezza e l’irrealtà di ciò che è troppo reale, da sempre disabituata all’uomo, Chatwin incontrerà un arcipelago di vite e di casi molto più sorprendente di quel che ogni esotismo permetta di pensare. Questa terra eccentrica per eccellenza è un perfetto ricettacolo per l’allucinazione, la solitudine e l’esilio. Qui i coloni gallesi versano il tè fra i ninnoli; qui circolano folli, che si trasmettono il titolo di re degli Araucani o coltivano la memoria di Luigi II di Baviera; qui si incontrano ancora elusivi ricordi di Butch Cassidy e Sundance Kid; qui si respira l’aria dei grandi naufragi; qui esuli boeri, lituani, scozzesi, russi, tedeschi vaneggiano sulle loro patrie perdute; qui Darwin incontrò aborigeni dal linguaggio sottile, e li trovò così «abietti» da dubitare che appartenessero alla sua stessa specie; qui si contemplano unicorni dipinti nelle caverne; qui sopravvive qualcuno che vuol far dimenticare un atroce passato. Come un nuovo W.H. Hudson, devoto solo al «dio dei viandanti», Chatwin ci racconta le sue molte tappe: fra baracche di lamiera, assurdi chalets, finti castelli, vaste fattorie. E ogni tappa è una miniatura di romanzo. Alla fine, la Patagonia sarà per noi pullulante di fantasmi, che si muovono sul fondo della «calma primitiva» del deserto, nella quale Hudson credeva di riconoscere «forse la stessa cosa della Pace di Dio». Pubblicato nel 1977 come opera prima, questo libro appartiene alla specie, oggi rarissima, dei libri che provocano una sorta di innamoramento. La Patagonia di Chatwin diventa, per chiunque si appassioni a questo libro, un luogo che mancava alla propria geografia personale e di cui avvertiva segretamente il bisogno.',\n",

The other vanished forever into an endless jungle. Had he shed civilization—or lost his mind? Global headline suspected murder. Lured by these mysteries, New York Times bestselling author Carl Hoffman journeyed to find the truth, discovering that nothing is a it seems in the world’s last Eden, where the line between sinner and saint blur into one. In 1984, Swiss traveler Bruno Manser joined an expedition to the Mulu cave on Borneo, the planet’s third largest island. There he slipped into the forest interior to make contact with the Penan, an indigenous tribe of peace-loving nomad living among the Dayak people, the fabled “Headhunters of Borneo.” Bruno lived for year with the Penan, gaining acceptance a a member of the tribe. However, when commercial logging began devouring the Penan’s homeland, Bruno led the tribe against these outside forces, earning him status a an enemy of the state, but also worldwide fame a an environmental hero. He escaped captivity under gunfire twice, but the strain took a psychological toll. Then, in 2000, Bruno disappeared without a trace. Had he become a madman, a hermit, or a martyr? American Michael Palmieri is, in many ways, Bruno’s opposite. Evading the Vietnam War, the Californian wandered the world, finally settling in Bali in the 1970s. From there, he staged expedition into the Bornean jungle to acquire astonishing art and artifact from the Dayaks. He would become one of the world’s most successful tribal-art field collectors, supplying sacred work to prestigious museum and wealthy private collectors. And yet suspicion shadowed this self-styled buccaneer who made his living extracting the treasure of the Dayak: Was he preserving or exploiting native culture? As Carl Hoffman unravels the deepening riddle of Bruno’s disappearance and seek answer to the question surrounding both men, it becomes clear saint and sinner are not so easily defined and Michael and Bruno are, in a sense, two part of one whole: each spent his life in pursuit of the sacred fire of indigenous people. The Last Wild Men of Borneo is the product of Hoffman’s extensive travel to the region, guided by Penan through jungle path traveled by Bruno and by Palmieri himself up river to remote villages.

       " '\"Lands of Lost Borders carried me up into a state of openness and excitement I haven’t felt for years. It’s a modern classic.\" —Pico Iyer A brilliant, fierce writer make her debut with this enthralling travelogue and memoir of her journey by bicycle along the Silk Road—an illuminating and thought-provoking fusion of The Places in Between, Lab Girl, and Wild that dare u to challenge the limit we place on ourselves and the natural world. As a teenager, Kate Harris realized that the career she craved—to be an explorer, equal part swashbuckler and metaphysician—had gone extinct. From what she could tell of the world from small-town Ontario, the like of Marco Polo and Magellan had mapped the whole earth; there wa nothing left to be discovered. Looking beyond this planet, she decided to become a scientist and go to Mars. In between studying at Oxford and MIT, Harris set off by bicycle down the fabled Silk Road with her childhood friend Mel. Pedaling mile upon mile in some of the remotest place on earth, she realized that an explorer, in any day and age, is the kind of person who refuse to live between the lines. Forget charting maps, naming peaks: what she yearned for wa the feeling of soaring completely out of bounds. The farther she traveled, the closer she came to a world a wild a she felt within. Lands of Lost Borders is the chronicle of Harris’s odyssey and an exploration of the importance of breaking the boundary we set ourselves; an examination of the story border tell, and the restriction they place on nature and humanity; and a meditation on the existential need to explore—the essential longing to discover what in the universe we are doing here. Like Rebecca Solnit and Pico Iyer, Kate Harris offer a travel account at once exuberant and reflective, wry and rapturous. Lands of Lost Borders explores the nature of limit and the wildness of the self that can never fully be mapped. Weaving adventure and philosophy with the history of science and exploration, Lands of Lost Borders celebrates our connection a human to the natural world, and ultimately to each other—a belonging that transcends any fence or story that may divide us.',\n",

       " 'Mother Ann Lee, founder of the Shakers, articulated a vision of a community that embraced sacrifice over the need of the individual; the result wa one of the most successful utopian experiment of nineteenth-century America. The Shakers, an idealistic offshoot of the ascetic Quaker religion, grew to a many a six thousand member in nineteen community reaching from New England to the Midwest. Lee’s experiment, focused mainly on simplicity, celibate communal living, and sexual equality, provided a model of prosperity for more than one hundred years. Founded in 1806, Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill, Kentucky, wa a thriving community located in the center of the bluegrass region. After the Civil War, a steadily shrinking membership resulted in the gradual decline of this remarkable community, and the last remaining Shaker to reside at Pleasant Hill died in 1923. In the year immediately following, it appeared a though the village would fall prey to neglect and a lack of historic preservation. In 1961, however, local citizen formed a private not-for-profit organization to preserve and restore the village and to interpret the rich heritage of the Pleasant Hill Shakers for future generations. Over several years, and against incredible odds, this group succeeded in raising the fund necessary for the restoration projects. By 1968, eight building at Shakertown, carefully adapted for modern use while retaining their historical and architectural significance, had been opened to the public. Thomas Parrish’s Restoring Shakertown masterfully explains how the Shaker settlement wa saved from the ravage of time and transformed into a nationally renowned landmark of historic preservation. In chronicling how the hope of the early fund-raisers quickly were challenged by the harsh reality of economic hardships, the book serf a a valuable study in modern philanthropy. Parrish also detail the village’s negotiation of legal challenge and how it final plan for creating awareness of the Shakers’ legacy set the standard for later museum development around the country. In addition to recounting the remarkable history of the formation and eventual demise of the “Shaking Quakers,” Parrish present a dramatic chronicle of the village’s evolving fortunes. From describing the challenge of financing the restoration to finding preservation expert to achieve the highest standard of authenticity, Restoring Shakertown reveals the complexity and reward of the preservation of one of Kentucky’s most significant historical and architectural sites.',\n",

Taken largely from her private lesson to her sisters, published here for the first time, Where There is Love, There is God unveils her extraordinary faith in and surrender to God’s will. This book is in some way a sequel to Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light, in which her own very private spiritual struggle were explained. Sent to alleviate the suffering of the poor, she assumed their struggle and pain in the depth of her heart. This led to particularly intense anguish which she lived through with heroic courage and fidelity over several decades.

Due to her constant interaction with people of diverse backgrounds, no life situation wa foreign to her and in this book her role is primarily one of teacher and guide. Love is perhaps the word that best summarizes Mother Teresa’s life and message. The title reflects what she proclaimed during her entire life: God is alive, present, and “still love the world through you and through me”. Mother Teresa sought to be an extension of God’s heart and hand in the world of today. She wa called to be a missionary of charity, a carrier of God’s love to each person she met, especially those most in need.

Through the practical and timely advice she offers, Mother Teresa set u on the path to closer union with God and greater love for our brother and sisters. MOTHER TERESA (1910–1997) wa born in Skopje (present-day Macedonia), and joined the Sisters of Loreto in Dublin in 1928. She left the Loreto order in 1948 to begin the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta. Her service to the poorest of the poor became her life’s work.

If I believe that the earth is 4.5 billion year old, am I denying the authority of Scripture?

What wa so frightening about Shapiro? He came to argue that Western civilization is in the midst of a crisis of purpose and ideas; that we have let grievance replace our sense of community and political expediency limit our individual rights; that we are teaching our kid that their emotion matter more than rational debate; and that the only meaning in life is arbitrary and subjective. As a society, we are forgetting that almost everything great that ha ever happened in history happened because of people who believed in both Judeo-Christian value and in the Greek-born power of reason. In The Right Side of History, Shapiro sprint through more than 3,500 years, dozen of philosophers, and the thicket of modern politics to show how our freedom are built upon the twin notion that every human being is made in God’s image and that human being were created with reason capable of exploring God’s world.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney exectuve produce the four-part series based on Pollan's book, and each episode will focus on a different natural element: fire, water, air, and earth. ** In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen.

The Brewer’s Tale is a beer-filled journey into the past: the story of brewer gone by and one brave writer’s quest to bring them—and their ancient, forgotten beers—back to life, one taste at a time. This is the story of the world according to beer, a toast to flavor born of necessity and place—in Belgian monasteries, rundown farmhouses, and the basement nanobrewery next door. So pull up a barstool and raise a glass to 5,000 year of fermented magic. Fueled by date-and-honey gruel, sour pediococcus-laced lambics, and all manner of beer between, William Bostwick’s rollicking quest for the drink’s origin take him into the redwood forest of Sonoma County, to bullet-riddled South Boston brewpubs, and across the Atlantic, from Mesopotamian sand to medieval monastery to British brewing factories. Bostwick compare note with the Mt. Vernon historian in charge of preserving George Washington’s molasses-based home brew, and he find the ancestor of today’s macrobrewed lager in a nineteenth-century spy’s hollowed-out walking stick. Wrapped around this modern reportage are deeply informed tale of history’s archetypal brewers: Babylonian temple workers, Nordic shamans, patriots, rebels, and monks. The Brewer’s Tale unfurls from the ancient goddess Ninkasi, ruler of intoxication, to the cryptic beer hymn of the Rig Veda and down into the clove-scented treasure hold of India-bound sailing ships. With each discovery come Bostwick’s own turn at the brew pot, an exercise that honor the audacity and experimentation of the craft. A sticky English porter, a pricelessly rare Belgian, and a sacred, shamanic wormwood-tinged gruit each offer humble communion with the brewer of yore. From sickly sweet Nordic grog to industrially fine-tuned fizzy lager, Bostwick’s journey into brewing history ultimately arrives at the head of the modern craft beer movement and gaze eagerly if a bit blurry-eyed toward the future of beer.',\n",

       " 'The art and secret of making fermented sausage finally revealed. The majority of book written on making sausage do not tackle the subject of fermented sausage at all. The topic is limited to a statement that this is an advanced field of sausage making which is not recommended for an amateur sausage maker. Well, the main reason for writing this book wa that the author did not share this opinion. On the contrary, they believed that any hobbyist could make wonderful salami at home, if he only knew how. For thousand of year we have been making dry fermented sausage without any understanding of the process involved. Only in the past 60 years, sufficient advance were made in the field of meat science which explained the fermentation and drying of meats. Until then, the manufacturing process wa shrouded in secrecy, and wa more a combination of art and magic than a solid science. Highly technical paper were published in Food Technology journals, unfortunately these work were written in such difficult terms, that they were beyond the comprehension of the average sausage maker. Thus wa born the idea of bridging the technology gap that existed between Meat Science and the requirement of the typical hobbyist making product at home. With more information obtainable every day, and commercial starter culture available to the public, there is little reason to abstain from making quality salami at home, regardless of the climate and outside conditions.',\n",
